Hi! This is a set of tools for programmatically creating rigs on top of pre-built skeletons

This toolset is currently designed to be run entirely through code, with the 

The main functional code is situated in `rig_on_skeleton.py`, and there are two example scripts for the rig building. 
These are `metahuman.py` and `brooke.py`.
